Prompts: 
make a python app for tracking wikipedia pages visited, and be able to make a tree / hierachy of wikipedia pages visited so you can keep track of rabit holes in certain subjects

yes

how can i make this project online not only on local

will anybody be able to use the website without downloading anything

why when somebody puts websites it changes the entire website to keep that in there

I want to let everybody have individually a blank slate on the website
and why is the graph weird, the children of a parent is upward when it should be more like a binary tree imo
